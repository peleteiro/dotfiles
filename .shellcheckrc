# ShellCheck configuration for dotfiles project
# This file configures shellcheck to work with modern utilities like sd, rg, etc.

# Note: SC2016 (Expressions don't expand in single quotes) is expected when using:
# - `sd` (sed replacement) - requires single quotes for regex patterns
# - `rg` (ripgrep) - single quotes are appropriate for literal patterns
# These warnings are intentionally suppressed with inline comments where needed.

# Enable external-sources to allow analysis of external commands
external-sources=true

# Shell dialect (bash 4.1+)
shell=bash

# Exclude common false positives for our project
# SC1091: Not following source files (we use validate-url which may not exist in all contexts)
# SC2034: Variables appear unused (some are used by external tools or git hooks)
# SC2016: Single quotes in sd/rg commands (intentional for regex patterns)

# We don't disable these globally, but document them here:
# - SC2016: Use inline `# shellcheck disable=SC2016` for sd/rg commands with single quotes
# - SC1091: Use inline `# shellcheck disable=SC1091` for optional source files
# - SC2034: Use inline `# shellcheck disable=SC2034` for intentionally unused variables
